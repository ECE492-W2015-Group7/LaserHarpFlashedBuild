 * Description:                                                           *
 * The following is a simple hello world program running MicroC/OS-II.The *
 * purpose of the design is to be a very simple application that just     *
 * demonstrates MicroC/OS-II running on NIOS II.The design doesn't account*
 * for issues such as checking system call return codes. etc.             *
 *                                                                        *
